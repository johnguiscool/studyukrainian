Like many other European languages, Ukrainian makes a distinction between masculine nouns and feminine nouns.  In general, these nouns can be distinguished as follows:

<p>

Feminine nouns:  All nouns ending with <b>-а</b> or <b>-я</b>
<br>
Masculine nouns:  All other nouns

<p>

The possessive pronoun [your] varies depending on whether it modifies a masculine or a feminine noun. 

<p>
<b>Твій</b> - masculine [your]
<br>

<b>Твоя</b> - feminine [your]

<p>
 
So we say:

<br> <b> Твій тато </b> and <b> Твоя мама</b> for [your father] and [your mother], respectively.
