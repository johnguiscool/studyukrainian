As with the expression of possession in general, there are two ways to express that one has siblings.

<ol>
<il>The <b>У мене</b> form.  As in: <b>У мене є брат </b>, literally [In me there-is brother] </il>
<il>The <b>Я маю</b> form.  As in: <b> Я маю брата</b>, literally [I have brother]</il>
</ol>

It is more typical to use the first form.  Thus to express [I have one brother and one sister], Ukrainians say:

<p>

<b>У мене є один брат і одна сестра.</b>

<p>

To express that one <i>does not</i> have a sibling, use the word <b>немає</b>, which means [there is not].

<p>

<b>У мене немає брат</b> means [I don't have a brother].

<p>

<b>﻿У тебе є брати або сестри?</b> is the informal version of the question, [Do you have any brothers or sisters?].  Note that this sentence translates literally to [In you there are brothers or sisters?].
