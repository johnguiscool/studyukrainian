You have a sad appearance, John
Yes, I am sad.
Why?
I like Maryanna, but she has a boyfriend.
Who is her boyfriend?
His name is Anton.
He is a manager at a big company.
He is rich.
But that is not important.
Women like pleasant, nice men.
But he is also very pleasant.
He is funny and he loves to dance.
Oy!  You have a problem.
When Anton was a student, he created an internet company.
Very interesting.
