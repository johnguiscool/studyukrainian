In this dialogue, John and Sofia are speaking to each other informally.  Thus they use the <b>ти</b> form of [you] rather than the <b>ви</b> form.

<p>

There are two ways to ask [What's your name?]:

<p>

<b>Як вас звати? </b> is the formal way.

<p>

<b>Як тебе звати?</b> is the informal way.

<p>

To ask the [Why?] questions, you can use the Ukrainian word <b>Чому?</b>.

<p>

When expressing your profession, again note that the [is / am / are] verb is omitted.  Thus to say, [I am a programmer], you say simply:

<p>

<b>Я програміст</b>, which means literally [I programmer].

<p>

To ask someone's profession, Ukrainians use the word [how].  Note that the word [how] has a version for masculine nouns <b>Як</b>, and a version for feminine nouns <b>Яка</b>.  Since <b> професія</b> is a feminine noun, we use the <b>Яка</b> form and say:

<p>

<b>Яка твоя професія?</b>.  Note that in this question, the [is] verb is omitted.
