In Ukrainian, although there do exist words for the verbs [is / am / are], in practice they are always omitted.

<p>

Thus to say [I am a student], Ukrainians just say [I student] or <b>Я студент</b>.  <p>To say [I am from America], Ukrainians, just say [I from America] or <b> Я з Америки </b>.

<p>

In questions, the verb [is / am / are] is also dropped.  To ask [Are you a student?], just say [You student?], i.e. <b> Ви студент?</b>.  <p> Similarly, to ask [Where are you from?], just say [From-where you?], i.e. <b>Звідки ви?</b>.

<p>

Note that the Ukrainians use a single word <b>Звідки</b> to express the phrase [from where].

<p>

The Ukrainian words for [Yes] and [No] are <b>Так</b> and <b>Ні</b>, respectively.

<p>

<b>Я</b> is the word for the pronoun [I].

<b>ви</b> is the formal form of the pronoun [you].
