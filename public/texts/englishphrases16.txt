Anton, is it possible to borrow your car?
Why do you need a car?
Because I want to go to the Carpathians.
Why to the Carpathians?
I want to visit the village where my grandfather was born.
I understand.  Of course!
Will you go alone, or with someone?
With Maryanna.
Nice.  When will you leave?
In the weekend.
