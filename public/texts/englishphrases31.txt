Maryanna, what are you thinking about?
John wants to read Ukrainian books,
so I want to give him my old books.
Which books will you give him?
I still don't know.
I must go home and look for good books.
Will you soon have your school vacations?
Yes.
What are your plans for the school vacations?
I will go to the sea.
With who?
With John.
Where exactly?
We will go to Odessa.
