There are two ways to express possession in Ukrainian, represented by the examples below.

<p>

To express the English sentence [I have a question]:

<ol>
<li> <b> Я маю питання </b>, which means literally [I have question].</li>
<li><b> У мене є питання </b> which means literally [In me is question].</li>
</ol>
<p>

Both of the above forms are acceptable.

<p>

To express the English question [Do you have a question?], we can use the following forms:

<p>

<ol>
<li><b> ви маєте питання?</b>, which means [You have question?].</li>

<li><b> У вас є питання?</b>, which means literally [In you is question?].</li>
